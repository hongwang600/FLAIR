# FLAIR

This repository contains the datasets and evaluation framework for the paper "[Bot or Human? Detecting ChatGPT Imposters with A Single Question](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06424)". The paper proposes a new framework named FLAIR (Finding Large Language Model Authenticity via a Single Inquiry and Response) to detect conversational bots in an online manner. The approach aims to differentiate human users from bots using single-question scenarios.
